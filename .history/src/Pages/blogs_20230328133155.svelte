      <p>In this tutorial, we will be using the JSONForge API to build a todo app in React. The app will allow users to create, read, update, and delete todos using HTTP requests.</p>
      <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
      <p>To follow along with this tutorial, you should have the following installed on your computer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Node.js (https://nodejs.org)</li>
        <li>NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/)</li>
        <li>React</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You should also have a basic understanding of React and web development.</p>
      <h4>Getting Started</h4>
      <p>First, let's create a new React app using Create React App:</p>
      <img class="img-fluid col-12 my-3" src="/img/p1.png" alt="code sample" />
      <p>Next, let's install the axios library, which we will use to make HTTP requests to the JSONForge API:</p>
      <img class="img-fluid col-12 my-3" src="/img/p1.png" alt="code sample" />
      <h4>Creating the Todo Component</h4>
      <p>Let's create a new component called Todo that will display a single todo:</p>
      <img class="img-fluid col-12 my-3" src="/img/p3.png" alt="code sample" />
      <p>The Todo component will take in a todo object as a prop and display the todo's title and description. It will also have a button that will allow the user to delete the todo.</p>
      <h4>Fetching Todos from the API</h4>
      <p>Next, let's fetch the list of todos from the API and display them in our app. We will use the useEffect hook to make the API call when the component mounts:</p>
      <img class="img-fluid col-12 my-3" src="/img/p4.png" alt="code sample" />
      <p>In this code, we use the useState hook to create a state variable called todos that initially contains an empty array. We use the useEffect hook to make a GET request to the API when the component mounts and store the result in the todos state variable.</p>
      <p>We then use the map function to render a Todo component for each todo in the todos array.</p>
      <h4>Creating a New Todo</h4>
      <p>Let's add a form to create a new todo:</p>
      <img class="img-fluid col-12 my-3" src="/img/p5.png" alt="code sample" />
      <p>
         <br/><br/>
         In conclusion, using the JSONForge API with React to build a todo app is a great way to practice your web development skills and gain experience working with APIs. We've covered the basic steps for building the app, including setting up the React project, making HTTP requests with axios, and displaying the data in the app using components. However, there is always more to learn and explore with web development, so keep experimenting and building new projects to continue improving your skills. With the knowledge gained from this tutorial, you should now be well-equipped to tackle more complex web development challenges in the future.
